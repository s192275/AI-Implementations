Büyük modellerde bu ağırlıklar sistemde çok fazla yer kaplar. 4 bit kuantizasyon yöntemi ile ağırlıklar normalden 4 ile 8 kat daha az yer kaplar. Ancak saklanan verinin kesinliğinin (precision) düşük 16 ve 32 bitliğe göre daha düşük olmasından dolayı sonuçlar teorik olarak biraz düşük çıkabilir. Ancak modern tekniklerle (örn.

Bu yöntemin amacı kuantizasyon sonrası performans kaybını önceden tahmin etmek ve minimize etmektir. Forward pass sırasında model, kuantize edilmiş ağırlıkları kullanır. Backpropagation sırasında gradient’ler float ağırlıklar üzerinden hesaplanır. Böylece model, kuantize edilmiş ağırlıkların getirdiği hataya \"alışır\" ve performans kaybı minimize edilir. Eğitim süresi artar, çünkü kuantizasyon simülasyonu ek hesaplama gerektirir.\n",

    "Kuantizasyon hatasını minimize etmek için local gradient’ler kullanılır (gradient descent ile optimize edilir, ama model yeniden eğitilmez). Sonuç olarak 4-bit veya 3-bit ağırlıklar, orijinal model performansına çok yakın bir doğrulukla elde edilir. Modeli yeniden eğitmek gerekmez. Post-training adımı, özellikle büyük modellerde zaman alabilir."
