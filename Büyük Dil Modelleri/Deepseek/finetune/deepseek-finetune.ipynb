    "Modeli FP32 veya FP16 olarak eğitirken aynı zamanda ağırlıkların kuantize edilmiş hallerini de simüle eder. Eğitim sırasında ağırlıklar hem float hem de kuantize edilmiş halde bulunur. Bu yöntemin amacı kuantizasyon sonrası performans kaybını önceden tahmin etmek ve minimize etmektir. Forward pass sırasında model, kuantize edilmiş ağırlıkları kullanır. Backpropagation sırasında gradient’ler float ağırlıklar üzerinden hesaplanır. Böylece model, kuantize edilmiş ağırlıkların getirdiği hataya \"alışır\" ve performans kaybı minimize edilir. Eğitim süresi artar, çünkü kuantizasyon simülasyonu ek hesaplama gerektirir.\n",

    "Kuantizasyon hatasını minimize etmek için local gradient’ler kullanılır (gradient descent ile optimize edilir, ama model yeniden eğitilmez). Sonuç olarak 4-bit veya 3-bit ağırlıklar, orijinal model performansına çok yakın bir doğrulukla elde edilir. Modeli yeniden eğitmek gerekmez. Post-training adımı, özellikle büyük modellerde zaman alabilir."

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the cystometry would show for this 61-year-old woman. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the patient has a history of involuntary urine loss, specifically when she coughs or sneezes. That makes me think of stress urinary incontinence, which usually involves the urethra and is often due to weakened pelvic floor muscles or urethral issues. But she doesn't leak at night, which is interesting because that suggests it's not just a problem with bladder capacity, which is usually more of a concern for nighttime leaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "She undergoes a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The Q-tip test is used to assess urethral function. If the test shows a positive result, it means there's a urethral obstruction, possibly due to a urethral incision or a urethral fold. If it's negative, it suggests the obstruction is at the bladder neck or the urethral orifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, if the Q-tip test is positive, that points towards a urethral cause for her incontinence. If it's negative, the issue might be at the bladder level, like a urethral orifice problem or perhaps something with the detrusor muscle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, thinking about cystometry. Cystometry is used to evaluate how the bladder responds to filling and emptying. It can show things like how much the bladder can hold (residual volume) and how well the detrusor muscle contracts during urination.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, since she's likely experiencing stress incontinence due to urethral issues, the cystometry might show that her bladder has normal capacity but perhaps abnormal emptying. Maybe the detrusor contractions are weak or not timed properly, leading to leakage when she coughs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, she doesn't leak at night. That makes me think that her bladder capacity is normal, and she doesn't have the typical overflow issues that come with nighttime incontinence. So, the residual volume might be within normal limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the Q-tip test is negative, then the issue is more likely at the bladder level. Maybe the urethral orifice isn't opening properly, so even when the bladder contracts, the urine doesn't exit effectively, leading to retention and possible overflow. In that case, cystometry might show some retention, but since she doesn't leak at night, the residual volume might be okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to organize my thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Q-tip Test Result**: Positive → Urethral obstruction. Negative → Bladder neck or urethral orifice issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cystometry Findings**:\n",
      "   - **Residual Volume**: Normal or increased? Since she doesn't leak at night, residual volume is probably within normal limits.\n",
      "   - **Detrusor Contractions**: Weak or normal? If the issue is urethral, the detrusor contractions might be normal but the emptying is obstructed. If it's at the bladder level, maybe detrusor contractions are normal but emptying is impaired.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key here is that cystometry would likely show normal residual volume because she doesn't leak at night. The issue is with emptying, not storage. So, the detrusor contractions might be normal, but the emptying is impaired, possibly due to urethral obstruction if the Q-tip test is positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but if the Q-tip test is positive, it's more about the urethral outlet. So, during cystometry, the detrusor contractions would be normal, but the emptying would be obstructed. Therefore, the residual volume might be normal, but there might be difficulty emptying, leading to the need for increased pressure or assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, cystometry would most likely show a normal residual volume and normal detrusor contractions, but impaired emptying due to urethral obstruction if the Q-tip test is positive. If the Q-tip test is negative, it might be a different issue at the bladder level, but the question doesn't specify the result, so I think the answer is based on the typical scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the standard answer is that cystometry would show normal residual volume and normal detrusor contractions, but impaired emptying, leading to the diagnosis of urethral obstruction.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Cystometry would most likely reveal a normal residual volume and normal detrusor contractions, but impaired emptying due to urethral obstruction. This conclusion is based on the positive Q-tip test result, which suggests urethral obstruction as the cause of the stress urinary incontinence. The patient's history of no nighttime leakage indicates normal bladder capacity and residual volume. The detrusor contractions appear normal, but emptying is impaired, likely due to urethral obstruction.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n"

We've got sudden weakness in the person's left arm and leg - and that screams something neuro-related, maybe a stroke?\\n\\nBut wait, there's more. The right lower leg is swollen and tender, which is like waving a big flag for deep vein thrombosis, especially after a long flight or sitting around a lot.\\n\\nSo, now I'm thinking, how could a clot in the leg end up causing issues like weakness or stroke symptoms?\\n\\nOh, right! There's this thing called a paradoxical embolism. It can happen if there's some kind of short circuit in the heart - like a hole that shouldn't be there.\\n\\nLet's put this together: if a blood clot from the leg somehow travels to the left side of the heart, it could shoot off to the brain and cause that sudden weakness by blocking blood flow there.\\n\\nHmm, but how would the clot get from the right side of the heart to the left without going through the lungs and getting filtered out?\\n\\nHere's where our cardiac anomaly comes in: a patent foramen ovale or PFO. That's like a sneaky little shortcut in the heart between the right and left atria.\\n\\nAnd it's actually pretty common, found in about a quarter of adults, which definitely makes it the top suspect here.\\n\\nSo with all these pieces - long travel, leg clot, sudden weakness - a PFO fits the bill perfectly, letting a clot cross over and cause all this.\\n\\nEverything fits together pretty neatly, so I'd bet PFO is the heart issue waiting to be discovered. Yeah, that really clicks into place!\\n</think>\\nThe specific cardiac abnormality most likely to be found in this scenario is a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This condition could allow a blood clot from the venous system, such as one from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, to bypass the lungs and pass directly into the arterial circulation. This can occur when the clot moves from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the arterial system, the clot can travel to the brain, potentially causing an embolic stroke, which would explain the sudden weakness in the left arm and leg. The connection between the recent travel, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and the neurological symptoms suggests the presence of a PFO facilitating a paradoxical embolism.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""

Bu sayede parametre sayısı 100 kat azalabilir. Performans çoğu zaman aynı kalır veya çok az düşer. Bu sayede eğitilecek parametre sayısı azalır, bellekte tasarruf sağlanır ve eğitim hızlanır.\n",

      "Okay, let's see. She's a 61-year-old woman with a history of losing urine involuntarily during things like coughing or sneezing but not at night. That's pretty typical for someone with stress urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence usually happens when the pelvic floor muscles aren't strong enough to hold the bladder closed during activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when they did the Q-tip test, I'm guessing it came back positive. The Q-tip test is a quick way to check for urethral obstruction. If the test is positive, that means there's some obstruction in the urethra, and it's probably affecting how she urinates.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the fact that her Q-tip test came back positive suggests there's some urethral obstruction. This could mean that her urethra isn't opening up smoothly, which might be causing some difficulty with urination. It might also be contributing to her stress incontinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, thinking about cystometry, what does it tell us? Cystometry helps us see how her bladder behaves under different conditions. It can show how much her bladder can hold and how much it contracts when it's full.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that she's experiencing stress incontinence, I'd expect her bladder to have some residual volume. That's because her pelvic floor muscles aren't holding up well, so the bladder isn't emptying completely during activities. That residual volume is probably more than what we'd expect in someone without incontinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, since she's having trouble with her urethra, it's likely that the detrusor contractions are a bit abnormal. The detrusor contractions are what help push urine out of the bladder. If there's some obstruction, these contractions might be weaker or less effective than normal, which could make the process of emptying her bladder harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, I'd expect her cystometry to show that she has more residual volume in her bladder and that her detrusor contractions are not as strong or effective as they should be. That makes sense given her history and the positive Q-tip test.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "Cystometry would most likely reveal that this 61-year-old woman has more residual volume in her bladder and that her detrusor contractions are not as strong or effective as they should be. This is consistent with her history of stress urinary incontinence and the positive Q-tip test, which suggests urethral obstruction.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n"
